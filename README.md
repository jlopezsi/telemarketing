# Motivation

The FCC allows people to complain about robocalling. It's awesome, and
can be done [here](https://consumercomplaints.fcc.gov/hc/en-us). It only
takes a few seconds.

They released a list of phone numbers that had complaints lodged against
them. With this in mind, I created a vcf file containing all these
numbers. It's a contact you can add in your address book.

# Installation

Download the vcf file from [here](https://github.com/shalecraig/telemarketing/releases/tag/0.0.1).

## Google Contacts

Drag & Drop the vcf file to add it to [google contacts](https://contacts.google.com/u/0/preview/all).

## iOS

I recommend adding a vCard via [iCloud](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH3605?locale=en_US).

## Android

Download the vcf file linked above to your phone, then click it. Your
contact app will open it up.
